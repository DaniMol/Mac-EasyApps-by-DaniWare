Ever had any troubles with eather Finder or Dock? Like the annoying download bar underneath your "downloads" folder that stays visible after your download is finished? Or your local network locations in Finder all for sudden stop working? I've got a simple solution that saves you from eather typing codes in Terminal or restarting your Mac.
It's a tiny app that makes your Finder and Dock applications restart immediately.
Just download the .zip file from the "releases" menu, extract it, copy the content to your Applications folder and make a shortcut in your Dock. Click it and you will be fine.
Compatible with OS X 10.6+ Use at your own risk!
